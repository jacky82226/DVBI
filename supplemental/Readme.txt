There are three things in supplemental for visualization.

1. drone-view-building-identification.m4v
Demo video by our proposed CVDT+Da+Dx+Dy in WB (mAP: 0.5015). We set single building as query for each drone-view frame.

2. Drone-BR.png
Dataset visualization for our collected Drone-BR

3. result_1.png, result_2.png, result_3.png, result_4.png
Four visualized results in Drone-BR by our proposed CVDT+Da+Dx+Dy in WB (mAP: 0.5015)
